## Developer comments

### Why Next.js?

Next.js is a modern framework for React, it let's you create React apps without having to worry about using bundlers like Webpack and transform the code using a compiler like Babel. So any user can clone this repo and then easily run the project on (almost) any machine.

#### To whom it may concern:

I'm sorry for the rather simple icons, I did them all by hand (Good old pure CSS). Also sorry for all the tiny little details I couldn't achieve, I had the clock ticking on my back and styling takes so much time.
